# metaecosystem_RCC

MATLAB and R scripts supporting "Meta-ecosystem dynamics drive the spatial distribution of functional groups in river networks" by Claire Jacquet, Luca Carraro and Florian Altermatt.

- `MAIN_setOCN.R`: create optimal channel network (OCN); read results from meta-ecosystem model produced by `MAIN_ODE.m` and produce Figures 3a--d.
- `MAIN_ODE.m`: read OCN, run meta-ecosystem model and produce the other manuscript's figures.
- `support`: folder containing supporting MATLAB functions and data
- `results`: folder containing results from the meta-ecosystem model and the different scenarios explored.
